%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

% The title (name) with a horizontal rule under it
% (optional argument typesets an object right-justified across from name
%  as well)
%
% Usage: \makeheading{name}
%        OR
%        \makeheading[right_object]{name}
%
% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.
% If ``right_object'' is provided in the square-braced optional
% argument, it will be right justified on the same line as ``name'' at
% the top of the CV. For example:
%
%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
%
%   \makeheading[\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{my_picutre}]{Your Name}
%
% the picture will be flush right across from the name.

% The section headings
%
% Usage: \section{section name}
%
% Follow this section IMMEDIATELY with the first line of the section
% text. Do not put whitespace in between. That is, do this:
%
%       \section{My Information}
%       Here is my information.
%
% and NOT this:
%
%       \section{My Information}
%
%       Here is my information.
%
% Otherwise the top of the section header will not line up with the top
% of the section. Of course, using a single comment character (%) on
% empty lines allows for the function of the first example with the
% readability of the second example.
